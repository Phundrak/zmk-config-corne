# P’undrak’s zmk config

![IMG_0446](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f24f8bd-588f-4f2e-bc61-a1301dc8450f)

This is my custom config for my ZMK corne keyboard. I’m using [Nickcoutsos’ keymap editor](https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-editor/) to configure my Corne keyboard.

Currently, there’s not much done on the `master` branch, you probably want to take a look at the `fake_bepo` branch.
